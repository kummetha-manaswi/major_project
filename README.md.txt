MAJOR PROJECT

Title
Data Handling and Processing System

Overview
This project presents the implementation of a structured program designed to read, organize and process a dataset to produce meaningful results. The work demonstrates the practical application of programming concepts in solving a real problem through step by step execution.

Purpose
The purpose of this project is to understand how data can be handled in a systematic manner and converted into useful information. It focuses on improving logical reasoning, data interpretation and implementation skills.

Working Principle
The program accepts input data from the dataset file.
It performs required operations and transformations.
Intermediate outputs are verified for correctness.
The final result is generated after completing all processing steps.

Tools and Technologies
Python
Jupyter Notebook
Standard Python libraries

Project Files
p1.ipynb – Input reading and initial preparation
p2.ipynb – Processing and calculations
p3.ipynb – Final result generation
Dataset – Source data used by the program

Execution Procedure
Install Python in the system
Install required libraries
Open Jupyter Notebook
Run the notebooks in order

Outcome
The system successfully processes the dataset and produces accurate output according to the designed logic.

Conclusion
This project demonstrates the application of programming techniques to process data effectively. It enhances problem solving ability and practical coding experience.
